# Project_Decoder_Ring

## Summary
The Decoder Ring Project works to encode and decode messages using JavaScript functions.
It's useful for anyone wanting to send their friend an encrypted message, or to decode a message that was received.
I built this to further solidify skills in JavaScript and working with complex algorithms, as well as giving users a fun way to encrypt messages.

## Tools Used
- JavaScript
- Helper and higher order functions
- Mocha, Chai for unit testing

## Project Takeaways
From working on this project I became more comfortable manipulating data in order to make the encrypted messages. Turning letters into numbers
and vice-versa made more sense after seeing how the separate functions/datasets worked.
